# Mount Helper
Mount helper is an open source automation tool that helps to establish secure IPsec connection between customer virtual server instance (VSI) and storage server. The mount helper ensures that the communication between the customer VSI and the file share is encrypted in transit.

For more information, see the [IBM Cloud File Share Mount Helper utility](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit&interface=ui#fs-mount-helper-utility) topic in the IBM Cloud Docs.
